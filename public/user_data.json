I have knowledge of a lot of technologies that I have to use professionally in frontend, backend, servers, etc so I consider myself a Full Stack developer, but if you are here looking for my superpowers or something like that, I am particularly good with PHP, NodeJs and Vuejs but my secret is getting things done.
